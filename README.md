# Hello-World-Client

This is an example http client using protocol buffers
sending to a rest endpoint in Lisp.
We use the [cl-protobufs](https://github.com/qitab/cl-protobufs)
protocol buffer implemenation and the
[Drakma](https://github.com/edicl/drakma) client.


The author makes no claim of optimality.
Ssome work should be done to have better protocol buffer
support in the client. This is left as an exercise to the reader.
